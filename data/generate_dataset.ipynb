    "The customer-based Scheduling Dataset is a collection of JobShop instances with an additional feature for each job, linking every job to a given customer. Customers may seen as the ones who ordered the job, or any other characteristic that may affect a given priority for the job to be completed. We assume the job's customer is drawn from a categorical distribution of a finite pool of possible customers, with different oracle priority values, related to the probability of such customer to contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first suppose these probabilities and priorities do not change over time, however this may sound unrealistic, the priority of a job is not fully determined by the customer priority, and can change in various unpredictable ways. We model this uncertainty by addressing a customer uncertainty to the priority, the job priority is then sampled from this distribution and revealed to the online policy, which takes decision with the sampled priority, which will be further unknown."
