    Adds constraints to the model to enforce that if all indicator variables are 1, then the comparison must hold.
    It is equivalent to:
    - all indicators == 1 -> lhs â‹ˆ rhs
    - any indicator  == 0 -> lhs is unconstrained

    Parameters:
        model (LpProblem): The PuLP problem instance.
        lhs (LpVariable | LpAffineExpression): The left-hand side variable or expression.
        rhs (LpVariable | LpAffineExpression | int | float, optional): The right-hand side variable or value. Defaults to 0.
        operator (str, optional): The comparison operator ("==", "<=", ">="). Defaults to "==".
        indicators (Iterable[LpVariable] | LpVariable, optional): The indicator variables. If None, a new variable is created. Defaults to None.
        big_m (float, optional): A large constant for the big-M method. Defaults to 1e6.

        When choosing a value for `big_m`, ensure it is large enough to not constrain the model unnecessarily,
        the ideal value is typically upper_bound(lhs) - lower_bound(rhs) if known.
